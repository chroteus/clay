 ======= Crossings Multiply algorithm ===================================
 * This version is usually somewhat faster than the original published in
 * Graphics Gems IV; by turning the division for testing the X axis crossing
 * into a tricky multiplication test this part of the test became faster,
 * which had the additional effect of making the test for "both to left or
 * both to right" a bit slower for triangles than simply computing the
 * intersection each time.  The main increase is in triangle testing speed,
 * which was about 15% faster; all other polygon complexities were pretty much
 * the same as before.  On machines where division is very expensive (not the
 * case on the HP 9000 series on which I tested) this test should be much
 * faster overall than the old code.  Your mileage may (in fact, will) vary,
 * depending on the machine and the test data, but in general I believe this
 * code is both shorter and faster.  This test was inspired by unpublished
 * Graphics Gems submitted by Joseph Samosky and Mark Haigh-Hutchinson.
 * Related work by Samosky is in:

 * visualizing sections through three-dimensional medical image data",

--[[ Shoot a test ray along +X axis.  The strategy is to compare vertex Y values
 * to the testing point's Y and quickly discard edges which are entirely to one
 * side of the test ray.  Note that CONVEX and WINDING code can be added as
 * for the CrossingsTest() code; it is left out here for clarity.
 *
 * Input 2D polygon _pgon_ with _numverts_ number of vertices and test point
 * _point_, returns 1 if inside, 0 if outside.
