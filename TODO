FIX: Mid-battle peace doesn't give money.
FIX: AI cannot attack over sea
FIX: No tutorial for region upgrades.

These two bugs may be connected to each other.
FIX: Balls teleporting to enemy ball on 2nd battle.
FIX: Fighters are unable to attack some countries.


ADD: Intro telling that the world is in chaos and no country trusts another.

################### [Coherent gameplay] ################################
    Make use of region upgrades to balance the game and to make
    countries with lots of clay a bit more powerful than they are.
    
    Player will be stripped of fighters at start, and must get them afterwards.
    Although player will be weak at first, he will get stronger.
    To counter boredom that the easiness will give, enemy fighters'
    and countries' stats will rise (something like Oblivion), but with
    a limit, to counter a problem: bandits with Daedric armor, but with Clay.
    
    Add more skills, items, fighter types.

################### [Army and fighter balls] ###########################
    Custom balls like UPA-ball for Ukraine, for example.
    A mercenary "shop"
    Levelling up of balls.

######################### [Game end] ###################################
	Game end upon conquering everything.
#======================================================================#


####################### [Diplomacy] ####################################
    Peace for money.
#======================================================================#


#################### [Random events] ###################################
    Riots, which decrease countries' amount of money [DONE]
    or make its regions join neighbouring countries. (Khohol Power!)
#======================================================================#


##################### [Africa] #########################################
    Most of the Africa is uninhabited allowing you to claim it, 
    but you'll need to fight natives first. This is done because creating
    every country in Africa is hard.

Make enemy lists for a country scrollable. [MAYBE, not really needed]
